# pure-css-reset
While Pure CSS is pretty unopinionated there's still a few things it could touch less. This CSS fixes some of those and adds some useful classes that pure lacks.

http://purecss.io

What it does:
* adds a container for each media breakpoint
* hidden classes for each breakpoint
* show classes for each breakpoint
* clear float class
* reset some mobile input styles
* better heading font sizes
* error styles for control groups
